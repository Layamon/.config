coc.nvim is really powerfully, but when I move devlopment from powerful server to local virtual machine, it seems
slow, such as this clangd-cpu-high issue (https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/512#issuecomment-1861925903), search
the google, not get any answers; it maybe not coc's problem, someone can tell me what it is...

thanks to repo(https://github.com/findNextStep/mydot), when I use coc, it configuration matchs my workflows. here when 
I want to try the native lsp support of nvim, I try to write configuration by myself, to check whether it is better than coc.
